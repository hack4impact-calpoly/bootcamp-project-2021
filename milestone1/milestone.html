        <!--Introduction-->
        <h2>Welcome to Bites with Jacqueline!</h2>
        <p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, many of us were in quarantine and found ourselves with some free time in our hands.

There are some people who can pick up cooking as if they were born with the skill and some people who need a lot of time and practice to pick up cooking. I fall in the latter.<br><br>That's why I created this page to share foolproof recipes that even beginners can't mess up on! Go ahead and take a look at easy recipes to make down below.</p>
