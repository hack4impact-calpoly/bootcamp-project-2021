                <li>1 bunch of cilantro</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Peanut Sauce</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>3/4 cup of sweet chili sauce</li>
                <li>1/3 cup of peanut butter</li>

        <!--Instructions-->

            <h3 class="section_title">Instructions</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Cook vermicelli noodles in boiling water according to 
                    package instructions. Drain and rinse with cold water.</li>
                <li>Gather all topping ingredients together (including chopped 
                    veggies, herbs, cooked shrimp).</li>
                <li>Add about 1 inch of water to a large, deep dish. Place one 
                    rice paper into the water and soak for 10 to 15 seconds 
                    (it should still feel firm as it is removed and laid on 
                    the plate.</li>
                <li>Layer 1 to 2 slices of each veggie, a few shrimp, a few 
                    leaves of each herb, and a pinch of noodles on 1/3 of the 
                    rice paper closest to you. The rice paper will soften as 
                    the topping ingredients are added. If soaked too long, the 
                    rice paper will tear when rolled up.</li>
                <li>Fold the sides of the spring roll in over the ingredients. 
                    Pull the side closest to you up and over the ingredients, 
                    sealing everything together tightly and rolling it up.</li>
                <li>Add all of the peanut sauce ingredients into a food 
                    processor or blender and pulse until smooth.</li>
            </ol>
