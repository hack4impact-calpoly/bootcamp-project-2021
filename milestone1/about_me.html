        <p>Hello! My name is Jacqueline and I am a Computer Engineering 
            student at Cal Poly SLO. As a college student, I donâ€™t have 
            a lot of time nor money to spend on cooking nowadays. 
            Whenever I make meals for myself, I make them quick, simple, 
            and delicious (I need that easy burst of flavor to distract 
            me from the stress of being an engineer).</p>
        <p>During my free time, I enjoy searching for easy recipes to 
            make, going on walks, and occasionally playing video games.</p>
        <p>Fun Fact: I have walked at least 20 miles a day at one point. 
            Being a good student, I would rewatch lecture videos while 
            walking. Ah multitasking is great!</p>
