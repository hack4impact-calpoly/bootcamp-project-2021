                            <br>back home, panna cotta was my mother's favorite dessert. in the mornings, before my classes would start, i would
                            bike to the groceries, pick up cream, and let it set in the fridge while i was in class, so when she was finished with work,
                            it would be ready for her. <br> <br> this yummy italian dessert is a sweet cream thickened with gelatin, and traditionally flavored with vanilla and served with honey.
                            however, this take incorporates the delicate aroma of almond, to lend another layer of mellow complexity to the dessert. it brings warmth to the 
                            cold dish, and evokes some of the aromatic qualities associated with india and the culinary culture.
