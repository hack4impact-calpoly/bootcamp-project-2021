            <br>
            <a>A bagel (Yiddish: בײגל‎, romanized: beygl; Polish: bajgiel; also historically spelled beigel) is a
                bread product originating in the Jewish communities of Poland. It is traditionally shaped by hand into
                the form of a ring from yeasted wheat dough, roughly hand-sized, that is first boiled for a short time
                in water and then baked. The result is a dense, chewy, doughy interior with a browned and sometimes
                crisp exterior. Bagels are often topped with seeds baked on the outer crust, with the traditional ones
                being poppy and sesame seeds. Some may have salt sprinkled on their surface, and there are different
                dough types, such as whole-grain and rye</a>

            <br>
            <ol>
                <li> Prepare the dough: Whisk the warm water and yeast together in the bowl of your stand mixer fitted
                    with a dough hook attachment. Cover and allow to sit for 5 minutes.</li>
                <li> Add the flour, brown sugar, and salt. Beat on low speed for 2 minutes. The dough is very stiff and
                    will look somewhat dry.</li>
                <li> Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. With lightly floured hands, knead the dough for
                    4-5 minutes. The dough is too heavy for the mixer to knead it!</li>
                <li> Lightly grease a large bowl with oil or nonstick spray. Place the dough in the bowl, turning it to
                    coat all sides in the oil. Cover the bowl with aluminum foil, plastic wrap, or a clean kitchen
                    towel. Allow the dough to rise at room temperature for 60-90 minutes or until double in size.</li>
                <li> Line two large baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats.</li>
                <li> Shape the bagels: When the dough is ready, punch it down to release any air bubbles. Divide the
                    dough into 8 equal pieces. (Just eyeball it– doesn’t need to be perfect!) Shape each piece into a
                    ball. Press your index finger through the center of each ball to make a hole about 1.5 – 2 inches in
                    diameter. Watch video above for a visual. Loosely cover the shaped bagels with kitchen towel and
                    rest for a few minutes as you prepare the water bath.</li>
                <li> Preheat oven to 425°F (218°C).</li>
                <li> Water bath: Fill a large, wide pot with 2 quarts of water. Whisk in the honey. Bring water to a
                    boil, then reduce heat to medium-high. Drop bagels in, 2-4 at a time, making sure they have enough
                    room to float around. Cook the bagels for 1 minute on each side.</li>
                <li> Using a pastry brush, brush the egg wash on top and around the sides of each bagel. Place 4 bagels
                    onto each lined baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, rotating the pan halfway through. You want the
                    bagels to be a dark golden brown. Remove from the oven and allow bagels to cool on the baking sheets
                    for 20 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
                <li> Slice, toast, top, whatever you want! Cover leftover bagels tightly and store at room temperature
                    for a few days or in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.</li>
