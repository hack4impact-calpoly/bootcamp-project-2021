    description:
      "Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe is a classic Italian pasta dish and one of my personal favorites. It's easy to understand why when you mix two of the best things in the world, cheese and pepper. The secret to this recipe is to use pecorino cheese, which won't lump up when making the sauce, and to use crushed whole peppercorns, for a strong peppery aroma! On top of this, we will use a slow whisking method when adding the cream so that we absorb all the flavor of the powerful pecorino cheese.",

      "Briefly stir your Pecorino cream over the steam of the pan with hot water, so the cream approaches a temperature similar to the pasta.",
      "Turn the heat off in the pan and pour in the Pecorino cream, stirring continuously with the tongs. Also add the remaining grated pecorino that you put aside from earlier.",
