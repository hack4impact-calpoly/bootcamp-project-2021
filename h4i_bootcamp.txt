The Box Model

Everyblock level HTML Element has 4 Layers

Content: Text exists
Padding: Wraps around content, doesn't include text but is colored by background color
Border: Thin rim spearating padding from margin
Margin: Outermost layer, keeps separation between boxes

<div? is a regular HTML Element
    Used to group together elements and format them together
    Can use css: flex to style divs together


Flex boxes used to style content / divs on page - not the only way of positioning stuff


Git -
git clone <url>
git add . - Stages to local branch
git commit - Do before push
git push - Push to GitHub repository
git pull

git commit -m "Message" - Commits to local branch

Using Git in software teams
Branches allow multiple programmers to work on multiple features
Everytime you work on a new feature, create a new branch so that not everything is in the master repository

Workflow:
Pull to make sure local repo is up to date
Create a new bracnh with git checkout -b <branch name>
Save, stage, and commit as normal
Then make a pull request on GitHub

Pull request is code-reviewed and then fixed, repeat, etc

If merge conflicts occur:
Pull changes into your local master repository
Call git merge master
Then fix conflicts in your include
Commit and then push those changes
