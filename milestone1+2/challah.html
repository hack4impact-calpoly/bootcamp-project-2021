            <br>
            <a id="description">Challah is a special bread of Ashkenazi Jewish origin, usually braided and typically
                eaten
                on ceremonial occasions such as Shabbat and major Jewish holidays (other than Passover).
                For the past year or so my family has gotten into the tradition of baking challah each Friday.
                Our system is I would make the dough in the early afternoon and hire my sisters to braid and bake it
                so it is ready for dinner!</a>

            <ol id="instructionList">
                <li> In a large bowl, dissolve yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in 1 3/4 cups lukewarm water.</li>
                <li> Whisk oil into yeast, then beat in 4 eggs, one at a time, with remaining sugar and salt. Gradually
                    add flour. When dough holds together, it is ready for kneading. (You can also use a mixer with a
                    dough hook for both mixing and kneading.)</li>
                <li> Turn dough onto a floured surface and knead until smooth. Clean out bowl and grease it, then return
                    dough to bowl. Cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, until almost
                    doubled in size. Dough may also rise in an oven that has been warmed to 150 degrees then turned off.
                    Punch down dough, cover and let rise again in a warm place for another half-hour.</li>
                <li> To make a 6-braid challah, either straight or circular, take half the dough and form it into 6
                    balls. With your hands, roll each ball into a strand about 12 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.
                    Place the 6 in a row, parallel to one another. Pinch the tops of the strands together. Move the
                    outside right strand over 2 strands. Then take the second strand from the left and move it to the
                    far right. Take the outside left strand and move it over 2. Move second strand from the right over
                    to the far left. Start over with the outside right strand. Continue this until all strands are
                    braided. For a straight loaf, tuck ends underneath. For a circular loaf, twist into a circle,
                    pinching ends together. Make a second loaf the same way. Place braided loaves on a greased cookie
                    sheet with at least 2 inches in between.</li>
                <li> Beat remaining egg and brush it on loaves. Either freeze breads or let rise another hour.</li>
                <li> If baking immediately, preheat oven to 375 degrees and brush loaves again. If freezing, remove from
                    freezer 5 hours before baking. Then dip your index finger in the egg wash, then into poppy or sesame
                    seeds and then onto a mound of bread. Continue until bread is decorated with seeds.</li>
                <li> Bake in middle of oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden. Cool loaves on a rack.</li>
