      <p id="MealTitle"> Ingredients</p>
      <div>
        <ul>
            <li id="GHInfo">3/4 pound ground pork</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">1 cup minced cabbage</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">2 tablespoons minced ginger</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">6 minced scallions</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">1/2 cup plus 2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">48 dumpling wrappers</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">1 egg, lightly beaten in a bowl</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">4 tablespoons peanut oil or vegetable oil</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">1/4 cup rice vinegar or white vinegar</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p id="MealTitle"> Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li id="GHInfo">Combine meat, cabbage, ginger, garlic, scallion whites and 2 tablespoons soy sauce in a bowl with 1/4 cup water.</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">Lay a wrapper on a clean, dry surface, and using your finger or a brush, spread a bit of egg along half of it.</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">Place a rounded teaspoon of filling in center, fold over and seal by pinching edges together. </li>
            <li id="GHInfo">Place dumplings on a plate; if you want to wait a few hours before cooking, cover plate with plastic wrap and refrigerate. </li>
            <li id="GHInfo">To cook, put about 2 tablespoons oil in a large nonstick skillet and turn heat to medium-high.</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">A minute later, add dumplings, one at a time; they can touch one another, but should still sit flat in one layer. Cook about 2 minutes, or until bottoms are lightly browned and most of the oil has been absorbed.</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">Add 1/4 cup water per dozen dumplings to pan, and cover. Let simmer for 3 minutes.</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">To make the dipping sauce, combine remaining soy sauce, green parts of scallions and vinegar.</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">Uncover dumplings, return heat to medium-high and cook another minute or two, until bottoms are dark brown and crisp and water evaporates.</li>
            <li id="GHInfo">Serve hot, with sauce.</li>
        </ol>
