        <p id="dishDesc">
          Supplì are Italian street food typical of Roman cuisine. Traditionally
          supplì were made with a ball of rice, tomato sauce, and were often
          filled with chicken giblets, mincemeat or Provature, a cheese from
          Lazio, Italy. Today most supplì have a ball of mozzarella inside and
          are known for the string of mozzarella that comes when breaking the
          supplì apart. There are also many variations of supplì that can be
          found around the streets of Rome, many of which are based off of
          popular Roman/Italian pasta dishes. For example, one can find Cacio e
          Pepe, carbonara, and amatriciana supplì! <br />
          <br />

          mozzarella supplì!

    <!--Preparation section-->
    <div>
      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol id="instructions">
        <li>Set your broth to heat up, bring it to around a boil.</li>
        <li>While you wait, Peel the onion and chop it roughly.</li>
        <li>
          Drizzle oil into a frying pan, add the onion and brown for about 3
          minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour in the rice and stir to combine, toast for about 5 minutes over
          medium heat.
        </li>
        <li>Add boiling broth until the rice is covered.</li>
        <li>
          Pour in the tomato puree and stir well, continue to cook the rice by
          adding more hot broth as needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once cooked, with all the liquid absorbed, remove from heat. Add the
          grated Grana padona cheese (or parmesean).
        </li>
        <li>
          Add a pinch of pepper (and salt if you feel it is not salty enough)
          and stir.
        </li>
        <li>
          Transfer the cooked rice to a tray and distribute evenly to help it
          cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once cooled, put the rice in the fridge for ~2 hours, while you wait
          you can cut the mozzarella into large ~1/2 inch cubes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the rice has become dense, We can begin making the supplì! Make
          sure to moisten your hands so the rice doesn't stick!
        </li>
        <li>
          Take a large spoonful of the rice mixture in your hands and press down
          so it is indented in the middle.
        </li>
        <li>
          Place some mozzarella cubes in the middle and shape the rice around
          them, in the elongated form of a supplì! Repeat this process for the
          remainder of your rice mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once you have the supplì made, we can move onto breading by grabbing a
          bowl and beating your eggs in it.
        </li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt to the beat eggs.</li>
        <li>
          Take a supplì, dip it in the egg, then completely cover it in the
          breadcrumbs.
        </li>
        <li>
          Repeat the same process on that same supplì, dipping the already
          coated supplì back into the eggs and then breadcrummbs again. We want
          a nice thick coating.
        </li>
        <li>Repeat this process for the remaing supplì.</li>
        <li>
          Heat up plenty of corn oil to a temperature of arounf 329-338F, or
          165-170C.
        </li>
        <li>
          Submerge two supplì at a time until they are golden brown, then take
          them out and drain the remaining oil from them.
        </li>
        <li>Enjoy your hot and melty supplì!</li>
      </ol>
