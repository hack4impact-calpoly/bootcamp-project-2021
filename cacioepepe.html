        <h2>Cacio e Pepe</h2>
        <p>
          Spaghetti Cacio e Pepe is a classic Italian pasta dish and one of my
          personal favorites. It's easy to understand why when you mix two of
          the best things in the world, cheese and pepper. The secret to this
          recipe is to use pecorino cheese, which won't lump up when making the
          sauce, and to use crushed whole peppercorns, for a strong peppery
          aroma! On top of this, we will use a slow whisking method when adding
          the cream so that we absorb all the flavor of the powerful pecorino
          cheese.

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>0.7 lb spaghetti</li>
        <li>Black pepper corns, to taste (make sure you have a good amount)</li>
        <li>7 oz Pecorino Romano cheese (to be grated)</li>
        <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Preparation</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Grate the pecorino cheese and move to the side for later.</li>
        <li>
          Boil water in a pan, half as much water as you would usually use to
          cook pasta because we want the starch for later. Once it reaches a
          boil you can add salt to taste. Cook the spaghetti very al dente and
          keep the water afterwards.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the meantime, place the peppercorns on a cutting board and crush
          them with a pestle or a grinder (or any other tool you want).
        </li>
        <li>Pour half of the crushed pepper into a large non-stick pan.</li>
        <li>
          Toast over low heat stirring with a wood spoon then add a couple
          ladles of pasta water (from the spaghetti). The bubbles you see are
          from the starch in the water.
        </li>
        <li>
          When the pasta is done (very al dente), pour it into the pan with the
          toasted pepper and let it cook while stirring continuosly. Add another
          ladle or two of water if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          As you stir, keep pouring ladles of water only when the pan is almost
          completely dry. When the pasta is cooked you can move on to making the
          Pecorino cream.
        </li>
        <li>
          Pour half of the grated Pecorino cheese into a bowl and add a ladle of
          pasta water. Stir vigorously with a whisk. Add more water when needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          The add the rest of the Pecorino cheese, keeping some aside to garnish
          with later.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add cheese/water as needed to create a cream without lumps, it may
          take some careful adjustments to get the right consistency.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finish cooking the pasta, adding a little more hot water if necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
          Briefly stir your Pecorino cream over the steam of the pan with hot
          water, so the cream approaches a temperature similar to the pasta.
        </li>
        <li>
          Turn the heat off in the pan and pour in the Pecorino cream, stirring
          continuously with the tongs. Also add the remaining grated pecorino
          that you put aside from earlier.
        </li>
        <li>Stir and saut√© the pasta again, then move it to a plate.</li>
        <li>Enjoy your creamy and peppery Cacio e Pepe!</li>
