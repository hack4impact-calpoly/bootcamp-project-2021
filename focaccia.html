            <br>
            <a id="description">Focaccia (Italian pronunciation: [foˈkattʃa]; Ligurian: fugassa [fyˈɡasa]) is a flat
                leavened oven-baked
                Italian bread, similar in style and texture to pizza; in some places, it is called "pizza
                bianca". Focaccia can be served as a side dish or as sandwich bread.</a>

            <ol id="instructionList">
                <li> Proof the yeast. Add warm water (about 110°F, which you can measure with a thermometer if you want
                    to be sure it’s the right temp) and sugar to the bowl of a stand mixer with the dough attachment,
                    and stir to combine. Sprinkle the yeast on top of the water. Give the yeast a quick stir to mix it
                    in with the water. Then let it sit for 5-10 minute until the yeast is foamy.</li>
                <li> Knead the dough. (See alterate instructions below to knead by hand.) Set the mixer to low speed,
                    and add gradually flour, olive oil and salt. Increase speed to medium-low, and continue mixing the
                    dough for 5 minutes. (If the dough is too sticky and isn’t pulling away from the sides of the bowl,
                    add in an extra 1/4 cup flour while it is mixing.)</li>
                <li> First dough rise. Remove dough from the mixing bowl, and use your hands to shape it into a ball.
                    Grease the mixing bowl (or a separate bowl) with olive oil or cooking spray, then place the dough
                    ball back in the bowl and cover it with a damp towel. Place in a warm location (I set mine by a
                    sunny window) and let the dough rise for 45-60 minutes, or until it has nearly doubled in size.</li>
                <li> Second dough rise. Turn the dough onto a floured surface, and roll it out into a large circle or
                    rectangle until that the dough is about 1/2-inch thick*. Cover the dough again with the damp towel,
                    and let the dough continue to rise for another 20 minutes.</li>
                <li> Prepare the dough. Preheat oven to 400°F. Transfer the dough to a large parchment-covered baking
                    sheet (or press it into a 9 x 13-inch baking dish). Use your fingers to poke deep dents (seriously,
                    poke all the way down to the baking sheet!) all over the surface of the dough. Drizzle a tablespoon
                    or two of olive oil evenly all over the top of the dough, and sprinkle evenly with the fresh
                    rosemary needles and sea salt.</li>
                <li> Bake. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the dough is slightly golden and cooked through.</li>
                <li> Serve. Remove from the oven, and drizzle with a little more olive oil if desired. Slice, and serve
                    warm.</li>
