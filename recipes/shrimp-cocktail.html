          <h2>Shrimp Cocktail</h2>
          <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prawn_cocktail">Shrimp cocktail</a> is all about the shrimp: big,
            fat, perfectly cooked
            gorgeous shrimp. Paired with a tangy, fresh cocktail sauce, this delicious recipe is the
            perfect start to an evening filled with friends, food, and fun.</p>
          <p>We think 16–20 per pound are the perfect size, and that’s what this recipe was developed for (the size will
            be printed on the bag the shrimp are packaged in, or ask your fishmonger). If you end up with a different
            size,
            just follow these guidelines: For 26–30, poach 1½ minutes; for 21–25, poach 2 minutes; for 13–15, poach 4
            minutes;
            for 8–12, poach 5 minutes. Proceed as written with the rest of the recipe!
          </p>
          <p>
            The recipe below is designed to act as a guide, and not something to be followed prescriptively. Play with
            your
            food! Adjust amounts based on your tastes.
