            <h2>Grilled Cheese</h2>
            <p>A spin on the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grilled_cheese">grilled cheese</a>.</p>
            <p>Traditionally, grilled cheese calls for bread, butter, and cheese. This version uses garlic and parmesean seasoning, combined with
        a culmination of cheeses to create an intricate blend of the "perfect bite". While it's not the most healthy foods reccomended, it's an absolute must on 
        cheat days! Note, there is enough cheese in this recipie so if you really think about it...you're getting your protein for the day:)
