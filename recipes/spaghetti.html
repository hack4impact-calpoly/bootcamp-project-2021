          <p>
            Making your sauce is always betterâ€”it's cheaper and so much more
            flavorful. This one comes together in about 15 minutes and is the
            perfect accompaniment to the big garlicky meatballs.

      <ol>
        <li>
          In a large pot of boiling salted water, cook spaghetti according to
          package instructions. Drain.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, combine beef with bread crumbs, parsley, Parmesan,
          egg, garlic, 1 teaspoon salt, and red pepper flakes. Mix until just
          combined then form into 16 balls.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large pot over medium heat, heat oil. Add meatballs and cook,
          turning occasionally, until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes.
          Transfer meatballs to a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add onion to pot and cook until soft, 5 minutes. Add crushed tomatoes
          and bay leaf. Season with salt and pepper and bring to a simmer.
          Return meatballs to pot and cover. Simmer until sauce has thickened, 8
          to 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Serve pasta with a healthy scoop of meatballs and sauce. Top with
          Parmesan before serving.
