            <h2>Spaghetti Squash</h2>
            <p>A spin on the standard <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasta">pasta</a>.</p>
            <p>Spaghetti Squash is a great alternative to using regular pasta. 
          While there is only one way to actually cook the squash, the dishes you can make with the cooked "pasta" are endless. 
          A perfect meal on a busy night!
