          <h2>Chocolate Chip Cookies</h2>
          <p>Truly a classic, this chocolate chip cookie features high quality ingredients that 
            will not only make this the best chocolate chip cookie you've ever had, but
            be a wonderful bookend desert to any meal in any occasion.</p>
          <p>What makes this recipe deliver on that promise? Crispy edges, a chewy center, and a recipe that turns out 
            consistently delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies every single time—all without a mixer.
            The browned butter is key to this recipe, helping it stay rooted in classic cookie flavor while also 
            contributing to that perfect balance of crisp-chewy textures—an ideal combo whether you dunk your cookies 
            in milk or not. The quality of the vanilla is also important here; we recommend 
            <a href="https://www.heilalavanilla.com/collections/vanilla-extract" target="_blank">Heilala</a> 
            or <a href="https://nielsenmassey.com/products/pure-vanilla-extract/" target="_blank">Neilsen-Massey</a>, 
            which both have enough heft to stand up to bitter chocolate and molasses-y dark brown sugar.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>Makes 16</p>

          <li>1½ cups (200 g) all-purpose flour (spooning into measuring cups, then leveling)</li>

          <li>¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar</li>
          <li>1 large egg</li>
          <li>2 large egg yolks</li>
          <li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>

        <h3>Preparation</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. 
            Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
          <br>
          <li>Cook ½ cup (1 stick; 113 g) butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, 
            swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, 
            then browns, about 4 minutes. Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute. 
            Cut remaining ¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to 
            melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is 
            incorporated and no lumps remain. Add egg and egg yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and 
            mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk in vanilla. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry 
            ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in chocolate (the dough 
            will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir 
            dough back together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour 
            hydrates).</li>
          <br>
          <li>Using a 1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-lined 
            rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, 
            just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking 
            sheets.</li>
          <br>
          <b>Do Ahead</b> Cookies can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature.
