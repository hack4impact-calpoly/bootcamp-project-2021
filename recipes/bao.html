          <p id="recipeDescription">
            The bao buns themselves are soft and puffy. Stuffed with zesty
            marinated tempeh, avocado, and lots of fresh fixings, they become
            mini explosions of texture and flavor.

      <h4 class="sub-heading">Directions</h4>
      <ol id="directionsList">
        <li>
          Make the Bao Buns. In a small bowl, combine the yeast, sugar, and
          water and stir. Set aside for 5 minutes, or until the yeast is foamy.
        </li>
        <li>
          In a large bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, and
          salt. Add the avocado oil and the yeast mixture and mix to form a
          rough ball, adding 1 to 2 tablespoons more water if the dough is too
          dry. Transfer to a lightly floured surface, shape into a ball, and
          vigorously knead it until it’s smooth and elastic, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brush the inside of a bowl with a little oil and place the dough
          inside. Cover and set it aside in a warm place for 45 minutes. (Note:
          it won’t rise as much as other traditional yeasted doughs.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Make the tempeh filling. Preheat the oven to 425°F and line a baking
          sheet with parchment paper. In a small bowl, whisk together the hoisin
          sauce, sriracha, ginger, and lime zest. Reserve half of the sauce for
          serving and toss the remaining half with the tempeh slices and set
          aside for 20 minutes to marinate. Place the tempeh on the baking sheet
          and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until browned around the edges.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finish the buns. Cut twelve 4-inch squares of parchment paper and
          place them on a large baking sheet. Transfer the dough to a clean work
          surface and roll out evenly to ¼ inch thickness. Use a 3-inch glass to
          cut out circles of dough and place them on the paper squares. Brush
          the tops with a little oil, then fold each circle in half and gently
          press down, flattening just a bit so that the halves stick together
          but you still have a puffy bun shape. Cover with plastic wrap and let
          rest for 1 hour, until puffed. Transfer to a bamboo steamer set over a
          pan with 1-inch water. Bring the water to a simmer, cover, and steam
          until puffed, 9 to 11 minutes. Work in batches.
        </li>
        <li>
          Assemble. Squeeze a little lime juice over the avocado, cucumber, and
          carrot. Assemble each bun with the tempeh, spooning a little sauce
          over each tempeh piece, the avocado, veggies, herbs, and chiles. Serve
          with remaining sauce on the side and lime slices for squeezing.
        </li>
