  <h1 id="title-text">Simple Pasta Primavera</h1>
  <p>In Italian, primavera means spring, and this classic warm-weather dish is surely a favorite this time of year on account of its celebration of all things light and fresh. It takes little more than vibrant seasonal vegetables to make a meal primavera style, but most traditional interpretations pair it with pasta. The recipe below is designed to act as a guide, and not something to be followed prescriptively. Play with your food! Adjust amounts based on your tastes. (I didn't realize this image had a watermark until now LOL).</p>

  <li>First you’ll bring a large pot of water to a boil, add salt, then cook pasta according to package directions. Reserve 1/2 cup pasta water before draining.</li>
  <li>While the pasta is boiling cook the veggies so they will finish at the same time as the pasta. To do so, heat olive oil in a 12-inch (and deep) skillet over medium-high heat. Add red onion and carrot and sauté 2 minutes. Add broccoli and bell pepper then sauté 2 minutes. Add squash and zucchini then sauté 2 – 3 minutes or until veggies have nearly softened. Add garlic tomatoes, and Italian seasoning and sauté 2 minutes longer.</li>
  <li>Pour veggies into now empty pasta pot or a serving bowl, add drained pasta, drizzle in lemon juice, season with a little more salt as needed and toss while adding in pasta water to loosen as desired. Toss in 1/4 cup parmigiano and parsley then serve with remaining parmesan on top.</li>
  <li>Serve!</li>
