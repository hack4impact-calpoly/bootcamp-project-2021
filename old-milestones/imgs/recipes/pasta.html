      <ol id="directionsList">
        <li>
          Fill a large pot 3/4 of the way up with salted water; cover and heat
          to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Medium dice the
          zucchini. Halve, peel, and thinly slice the onion. Peel and roughly
          chop 2 cloves of garlic. Place the currants in a bowl; cover with 1/4
          cup of hot water. Set aside to rehydrate at least 10 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Add the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring
          occasionally, 6 to 8 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm
          to the bite). Turn off the heat. Reserving 1 cup of the pasta cooking
          water, drain thoroughly and return to the pot.
        </li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat a drizzle
          of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the diced zucchini in an
          even layer; season with salt and pepper. Cook, without stirring, 3 to
          4 minutes, or until browned. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally,
          2 to 3 minutes, or until softened. Transfer to a plate and cover with
          foil to keep warm. Wipe out the pan.
        </li>
        <li>
          In the same pan, heat a drizzle of olive oil on medium-high until hot.
          Add the beef, sliced onion, chopped garlic, capers, and quatre épices;
          season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring frequently and breaking
          the meat apart with a spoon, 4 to 5 minutes, or until lightly browned.
          Add the tomato paste and chile paste; season with salt and pepper.
          Cook, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until thoroughly
          combined. Add the spinach, 1/2 cup of water (carefully, as the liquid
          may splatter), and rehydrated currants (including the liquid); season
          with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or
          until the sauce is slightly thickened and the beef is cooked through.
          Turn off the heat.
        </li>
        <li>
          To the pot of cooked pasta, add the cooked beef and sauce, browned
          zucchini, butter, and half the reserved pasta cooking water. Cook on
          medium-high, stirring constantly, 1 to 2 minutes, or until the pasta
          is coated (if necessary, gradually add the remaining cooking water to
          ensure the pasta is thoroughly coated). Turn off the heat. Stir in the
          crème fraîche until combined. Taste, then season with salt and pepper
          if desired. Serve the finished pasta garnished with the cheese. Enjoy!
