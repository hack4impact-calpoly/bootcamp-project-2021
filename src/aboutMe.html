                <p class="description">I'm currently studying abroad in Rome, Italy during Fall 2021. This trip inspired me to create an Italian food themed page! 
                    I've absolutely loved being imemrsed in Italian culture, and much of the culture revolves around food! My favorite foods thus far have been 
                    different kinds of pasta, pizza and (most importantly) gelato!</p>
