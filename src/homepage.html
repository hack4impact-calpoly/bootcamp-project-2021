                <blockquote style= "font-size: larger;" style="max-width: 200ch;">Hi! Welcome to my cooking(ish) page! I decided to make an Italian-themed cooking page because I am studying abroad in Rome this quarter! 
                    I absolutely love it here and the food is beyond anything I could have ever imagined. While I've been cooking for myself for a while now, I'm working to master the my 
                    favorite dishes that I have tried out here in Italy! I hope this website will inspire you to try (to eat or make) some of my favorite Italian dishes :)</blockquote>

                        <p class="text-description">Carbonara has by far been my favorite dish here in Rome. It actually originated in Rome so this is the best place to get it. 
                            The dish only requires a few simple ingredients, but is difficult to make well (trust me, I've tried). It's a simple pasta dish made from pasta, egg, 
                            cheese and pancetta.</p>

                        <p class="text-description">The pizza here in Italy doesn't even compare to my usual Domino's order at home. It's much more thin 
                            than US pizza and it doesn't feel as heavy. My favorite pizza is made from the simple combination of flour, fresh tomato sauce, 
                            and mozarella cheese (optional).</p>

                        <p class="text-description">I recently had the BEST risotto of my life in a small town called Anzio. I certainly don't know how to make 
                            this dish, much less make it well. But I wanted to share this dish in case anyone out there hadn't heard of it before. It's a delicious 
                            combination of rice (risotto) and a variety of seafood.</p>
