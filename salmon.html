      <h2>How To Make</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          First, preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 400°F and grease a baking
          dish that can fit all pieces of salmon with some oil.
        </li>
        <li>
          Next, make the marinade: Whisk lemon juice, garlic, oil, salt, and
          pepper into a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Marinade the salmon: Place the salmon fillets into a Ziploc bag and
          pour over the lemon marinade. Seal the bag and move the pieces of
          salmon to get them evenly coated with the marinade. Let marinate for
          at least 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Then, prepare the salmon: Now layer the lemon slices into your
          prepared dish and arrange the salmon on top.
        </li>
        <li>
          Bake the salmon: Bake the salmon for about 12-15 minutes until cooked
          through. Depending on the thickness of your salmon.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once done, lay a few slices of lemon on top of your cooked salmon and
          switch the oven to the broil setting. Broil for 3 minutes until the
          top is nicely golden and crisp.
        </li>
        <li>Finally, remove from the oven, garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
