                    <p>Helen Chan: a grandmother of four, a frying-pan conossieur, and a master in the kitchen. 
                        Born in Shanghai and raised in Hong Kong, Helen has mastered a variety of Chinese dishes, 
                        adding her own twists at the same time. For the past 27 years, she has taken care of her 
                        four grandchildren and raised them to be successful young adults. Her secret? A little bit
                        of love and some amazing home-cooked meals.</p>
                    <br/>
                    <p>As her only grandson, I was always spoiled with the best pieces of meat, the crispy rice 
                        at the bottom of the pot, and always got out of eating my veggies. I can say with ease that
                        my grandmother cooks the best Chinese cuisine in the world!
