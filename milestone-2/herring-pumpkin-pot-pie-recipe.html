         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>5-6 fish filets (anywhere between 100 - 300g)</li>
            <li>200-250g Japanese pumpkin (skinned and cubed)</li>
            <li>2 small potatoes (skinned and cubed)</li>
            <li>1 small onion (peeled and diced)</li>
            <li>150mL of water</li>
            <li>4 sheets of ready made puff pastry, defrosted (you only really use 3.5 sheets)</li>
            <li>11 olives (for decoration, not necessary for the recipe)</li>
            <li>Egg for egg wash</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>For the white sauce</h3>
         <ul>
            <li>Roughly 2-3 Tbs of butter/margarine</li>
            <li>Roughly 2-3 Tbs of flour</li>
            <li>1 C of milk</li>
            <li>Salt, pepper, nutmeg, thyme, parsley</li>
            <li>150-300mL of stock (I had chicken stock in the fridge, but fish would probably be better)</li>
            <li>100g grated cheese</li>
            <li>50-100mL of white wine</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol id="instructionList">
            <li>Preheat an oven to 180'C fan forced (200'C electric oven) and grease a ~23 casserole dish and line with two of the puff pastry sheets.</li>
            <li>Fry the diced onion in oil in a saucepan until transparent then add the pumpkin and potato and water, 1 tsp of salt and 2 tsp of sugar. Cover with a lid and boil until all the water's evaporated, stirring occasionally. Once it's softened, take off the heat and set aside. </li>
            <li>Make the white sauce
               <ol>
                  <li>Melt the butter/margarine over medium heat in a saucepan and add the flour. Stir the mixture constantly so it doesn't burn, and the flour begins to cook. </li>
                  <li>Add the milk bit by bit, stirring well between additions to get a creamy consistency.</li>
                  <li>Add the cheese and wine then add sufficient quantity of stock to make it up to volume.</li>
                  <li>If sauce is too runny, then simmer the sauce until sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
                  <li>Season with salt and pepper (nutmeg optional) and herbs.</li>
               </ol>
            </li>
            <li>Add the pumpkin mixture to the sauce and stir to distribute the pumpkin evenly. Re-season with salt and pepper if necessary. </li>
            <li>Pour half of the mixture into the pastry lined pan, then make a layer of fish fillets, then pour over the rest of the mixture. </li>
            <li>Roll out one of the puff pastry sheets to cover the filling then use the other puff pastry sheet for decorations. Use the olives for decoration, pierce the top of the pie with a knife, then brush with the egg. </li>
            <li>Put into the oven and bake for ~30-40 minutes until golden brown and the pastry top is puffed up.</li>
         </ol>
