        "name": "Gigi Hadid Pasta",
        "description": "The Gigi Hadid Pasta is nothing new, in fact it originated in Italy and is more commonly known as Spicy Vodka Pasta. It’s a creamy tomato-based sauce that starts off with cooking down some onions and garlic. Then tomato paste is caramelized in olive oil and heavy cream is added to turn it into a beautifully smooth sauce. And if that didn’t sound good enough, the final touches are butter, tons of freshly grated parmesan, and some pasta water. ",
