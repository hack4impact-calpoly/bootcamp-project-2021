        <p>
          After having studied abroad here in Rome these past few weeks I have
          become an expert in (eating) Authentic italian cuisine. Here's a
          picture of me at a (former) Michelin star restaurant.

        <h2>My cooking qualifications:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I've already spent several hundred dollars on food here in Rome

            I worked at an italian restaurant the past few summers back home
