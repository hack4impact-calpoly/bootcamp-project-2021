         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>Burrito-Size Flour Tortillas</li>
            <li>1/4 Cup Butter, melted</li>
            <li>1 lb. Ground Beef</li>
            <li>1 Pkt. Taco Seasoning + Water called for (~3/4 cup)</li>
            <li>1 Can Nacho Cheese</li>
            <li>1 Can Refried Beans</li>
            <li>Corn Tortilla Chips</li>
            <li>1 Tomato, finely diced</li>
            <li>Green Leaf Lettuce, a few leaves (only needed if doing the gathered bowl style)</li>
            <li> Sour Cream (optional)</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>In a large pan brown the meat and prepare it according to the taco seasoning packet instructions (seasoning powder + water). When you're cooking the meat make sure to break it up really well with a spatula. In 2 medium pots, warm up the refried beans & nacho cheese (1 pot for beans, 1 pot for cheese). Dice up the tomato & break several chips into smaller pieces.</li>
            <li>Gathered Bowl Style: Preheat the oven to 350ÂºF. Lay a tortilla on a baking tray & lightly brush it with melted butter. Place a ramekin in the middle & then gather up the edges of the tortilla around it. Tie a bit of baking string around the top section of gathered tortilla to hold it in place, pulling it enough so that the tortilla isn't simply straight up & down but comes in a little bit at the top (see photo). Brush some butter in the folds of the tortilla & lift the whole thing up to brush butter underneath, on the tray. Slide it all into the oven & bake until the edges of the tortilla are golden brown & the tortilla is stiff, about 5-10 mins. Remove from the oven & untie the string. Carefully open the tortilla gathers just a little bit, enough to remove the ramekin (I used small tongs & lifted at an angle). Put a couple of small lettuce leaves in the tortilla & then layer the other filling ingredients how you'd like, plus the optional sour cream.</li>
            <li>Triangle Style: Heat a large pan on medium heat. Lay a tortilla on a flat surface & use kitchen scissors to trim the edges so that you have a sort-of triangle (see photo). Layer the fixings on the tortilla in whatever order you'd like (optional sour cream, no lettuce) & then fold 1 corner in to the center, butter it, fold in another corner, slightly overlapping the first as shown, brushing with more butter, & then fold over the 3rd corner to overlap like an envelope. Brush the whole side with butter & lay it in the pan, fold side down. Brush the top with more butter. Cook for a few minutes, until the folds stay closed, & then flip the triangle over. Cook for another couple minutes. Remove to a plate and enjoy! The tortilla cuttings can be brushed with butter & baked or fried 'til lightly golden brown.</li>
