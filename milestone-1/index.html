            <h2>Fire Nation Turkey Leg</h2>
            <h3>Avatar: The Last Airbender</h3>
            <p>
               We’d like to think a simple gesture such as a homemade meal would
               have melted the Fire Lord’s heart, made him rethink using Sozin’s 
               comet to bring death and destruction, and accept his son back into
               his home with love.

            <h2>The Krabby Patty</h2>
            <h3>SpongeBob SquarePants</h3>
            <p>
               Don't tell Plankton, but as any astute watcher of Spongebob Squarepants
               knows, Krabby Patties aren't actually made with crab. I'm going to show you
               how to make a gourmet Krabby Patty, and it doesn't contain any crab, either.
               Nope. It's all shrimp.

            <h2>Ron's Naco</h2>
            <h3>Kim Possible</h3>
            <p>
               After Ron starts working at Bueno Nacho his creation is added to the
               menu and does extremely well (at least at store #582. Frustratingly for
               Ron, we later learn that it's no bueno at the store in Go City).

            <h2>Herring and Pumpkin Pot Pie</h2>
            <h3>Kiki's Delivery Service</h3>
            <p>
               This post we're up in the clouds, but first we've got some deliveries
               to make! Kiki's Delivery Service (魔女の宅急便) was released in 1989 and
               was based on the novel of the same name. The thing I most remember
               about this movie, was the bread.
