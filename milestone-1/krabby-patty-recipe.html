         <h2>Ingredients</h2>
         <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds peeled, deveined shrimp</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>10-12 regular sized or smaller hamburger buns</li>
            <li>Old Bay seasoning</li>
            <li>1 Tbsp your favorite hot sauce</li>
            <li>1 tsp celery seed</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic powder</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1 tsp cayenne pepper</li>
            <li>Lemon zest to taste</li>
            <li>Vegetable oil and/or butter for frying</li>
            <li>Butter lettuce</li>
            <li>Sliced tomato</li>
            <li>Pickled onions</li>
            <li>Tartar sauce</li>
            <li>Cocktail sauce</li>
         </ul>

         <h2>Instructions</h2>
         <ol>
            <li>First, take 3-4 of the hamburger buns and toss them into the food processor. Add all the dried spices, turn it on, and let it turn this into a very flavorful bread crumb mixture. Pour that into a big bowl. </li>
            <li>Same thing with the shrimp. Toss it in and pulse it until the mixture is mostly very small pieces with some chunks of shrimp visible. My goal is to get this to be almost the consistency of raw breakfast sausage. Toss this into the bowl with the breadcrumbs. Add the lemon zest and hot sauce. </li>
            <li>Crack an egg in there and mix it all up by hand.</li>
            <li>I grab an amount of chum that is somewhere in between a golf ball and a racquetball in size. Put some parchment paper or wax paper on a sheet pan and place your patties on the paper.</li>
            <li>Once you have 8 patties, you are going to put this into either the refrigerator for 1/2 an hour or more or the freezer for 15 minutes or so. I use the freezer. This step is essential for removing your quite moist patties from the paper.</li>
            <li>Put a healthy amount of vegetable oil in a non-stick pan and heat it up. I add 1-2 tablespoons of butter to this because butter and shrimp seem to go well together.</li>
            <li>Place four patties in the hot pan and cook on medium heat. Flip them carefully after 3-4 minutes and finish them for 3 minutes. Remove them from the pan and onto a plate.</li>
            <li>Then, assemble your masterpieces. I usually go with bun, tartar sauce, Krabby Patty, butter lettuce, tomato slice, pickled onions, more tartar sauce, and a small amount of cocktail sauce on the top bun.</li>
