        <p> Name: Sebastien Callait</p>
        <p> Major: Computer Engineering</p>
        <p> Year: 3rd Year</p>
        <p> Hometown: Pleasanton (Bay Area)</p>
        <p> Hi my name is Sebastien Callait. I was born in Pleasanton, California: a small town in the Bay Area. 
            I am a 3rd year computer engineering major at Cal Poly. I initially joined Cal Poly as an electrical
            engineering student until I realized I liked software a lot more than hardware, so I made the switch.
            My entire family is French and I speak it fluently and Spanish semi-fluently. I am currently studying
            abroad in Rome, Italy in the SE program. I love listening to music, hiking, climbing, exploring new
            places, surfing, and pretty much any water sport you can think of.</p>
