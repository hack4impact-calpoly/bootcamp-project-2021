                        i've tried making a cutesy wholesome lil website, but bits of my personality are slipping through as i progress
                        later into the night, so excuse me. but if you wanna get to know me better, i've included some crucial details about
                        myself below. 
                        <br><br> 
                        the picture on the right is the first decent one i found of me in my gallery. me n the homies are loitering in a parking lot.
                        i'm the sexy one on the left.
                    </p>

                        <li>i didnt like the greatest showman. at all. actually, everytime i have to play the music from it for some orchestra gig
                            or concert or performance or whatever, i consider quitting violin for good and pursuing a life out in the woods
                            where i won't have to be haunted by reminders of that horrid excuse for a film.</li>
                        <li>i am reenu</li>
                        <li>i am allergic to blue. dyes, food coloring, all of it.</li>
                        <li>there are very few days in my life in which i don't ponder why we as a society don't treat unicyclists and their artform with the respect that they deserve</li>
                        <li>i use she/her pronouns</li>
                        <li>i've cooked before (not too well)</li>
