                            <br> after he left his home in india, my father moved to dubai to find work. he doesn't always reflect fondly
                            on his years in the middle east, but one aspect of dubai which he does hold dearly is the culinary tradition.
                            years later, he's passed his love for these foods down to me. <br> <br>as a child, i shyed away from desserts. to me, they were repulsively sweet,
                            and oftentimes monotonous. baklava from an authentic eatery or from my father baking in the kitchen helped me recognize
                            the beauty of sweetness when used with subtlety and balance. <br> <br> this flaky middle eastern dessert not only connects me
                            to my father, and his fondness for middle eastern cooking, but it also summons childhood memories of sticky hands and new realizations.

                    <li>butter the bottom of a baking pan, and trim the phyllo to fit the pan (tip: keep the dough covered with a wet paper towel when it is out, to prevent drying)</li>
                    <li>combine the sugar, honey, lemon juice, and water in a saucepan, and bring it to a boil over med/high heat. stir until the sugar dissolves</li>
                    <li>once the sugar has dissolved, reduce the heat to med/low and boil for 4 more minutes without stirring</li>
                    <li>remove the syrup from heat, and continue with the next steps while it cools</li>
                    <li>preheat your oven to 325 degrees fahrenheit</li>
                    <li>pulse the walnuts until they are at a finely chopped consistency and stir it into a bowl with the cinnamon</li>
                    <li>place 10 sheets of phyllo into the pan, and brush each with butter before the next goes in</li>
                    <li>spread about 1/5 of the nut mixture over</li>
                    <li>add 5 sheets of phyllo in the same manner as before, and add another 1/5th of the mixture</li>
                    <li>repeat the step above 3 more times</li>
                    <li>finish with 10 sheets of phyllo with butter brushed between, and brush the very top with butter</li>
                    <li>cut the pan into strips about 1.5" wide, and then cut diagonally across the pan, to form beautiful little diamonds</li>
                    <li>pop into the oven for about 1 hour and 15 minutes, or until the tops are golden brown</li>
                    <li>remove from the oven, and immediately spoon the honey syrup (its gonna sizzle)</li>
                    <li>let it cool completely, uncovered, at room temperature (tip: i know its hard, but let it sit for 4-6 hours for the best results)</li>
                    <li>throw some more nuts on there, and share with someone you love</li>
