2021 bootcamp project

This repo will serve as a place to "turn in" your work. More info about bootcamp can be found on the [Developer Bootcamp Notion Page](https://www.notion.so/h4i/Developer-Bootcamp-7c97523fb0814ac39e5706b0795abda8).

To submit your work, create a pull request from your own fork (DO NOT MERGE if you are able to). This allows us to review your work in a reasonably quick manner.

For a walkthrough of how to turn in your work, check out this [Notion Page about git!](https://www.notion.so/h4i/Turning-in-Work-a739a09534a846aba2d96ccc11e179a3)
If you are still stuck, leave a message in the #cp-bootcamp-help channel on Slack, or reach out to one of your Bootcamp Instructors!
