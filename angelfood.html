                        <br> yes, i know what the site title is, but this recipe is definitely one of the harder baking recipes. a lot of things can go wrong.
                        my father works magic in the kitchen, cooks wonderfully, and loves the simple gracefulness of an angel food cake, but was never quite able to master this one.
                        however, as i've begun exploring cooking and baking over the last few years, i've come to learn that while spontaneity and personalization are
                        necessary for cooking, they have the ability to kill baking. <br> <br>if you attempt to create angel food cake, bring patience, decide on a recipe,
                        and follow it down to the last detail. this pretty, airy white cake will make all your hard work worthwhile.

                <ul>
                    <li>1.5 cups granulated sugar</li>
                    <li>1 cup and 2 tbsp cake flour</li>
                    <li>0.25 tsp salt</li>
                    <li>12 large egg whites (hopefully one of the other developers made a lemon curd or hollandaise sauce page)</li>
                    <li>1.5 tsp cream of tartar (a stabilizer for the egg whites)</li>
                    <li>1.5 tsp vanilla extract</li>
                    <li>garnishes: powdered sugar, fresh whipped cream, fresh berries</li>

                    <li>place the oven rack at the lower middle position and preheat the oven to 325 degrees fahrehnheit</li>
                    <li>pulse the sugar in a food processor until powdery, and remove 1 cup and save for later. this is so the sugar acheives a consistency between granulated and powdered sugar</li>
                    <li> add the flour and salt to the sugar in the food processor, and pulse 5 - 10 times</li>
                    <li>whip the egg whites and cream of tartar on medium low in a mixer (or by hand if youre tryna get those gains) until foamy (about 1 minute)</li>
                    <li>increase the speed to medium high and slowly pour in the 1 cup of sugar we separated. whip until soft peaks (about 5 minutes)</li>
                    <li>add the vanilla and beat until just incorporated</li>
                    <li>in 3 rounds, sift the flour mixture into the egg white mixture, and fold very slowly each time</li>
                    <li>pour the batter into a tube pan, and drop it against the counter to remove huge bubbles and smooth it out</li>
                    <li>bake for 40 - 45 minutes, and rotate the pan halfway through baking</li>
                    <li>remove the cake and cool it upside down on a wire rack for 3 hours</li>
                    <li>run a knife along the edges of the pan and tap the pan against the counter to help the cake release</li>
                    <li>cut with a sharp serrated knife, serve with a dollop of cream and berries, and share with someone you love</li>
