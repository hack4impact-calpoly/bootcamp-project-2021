      "description": "Carbonara has by far been my favorite dish here in Rome. It actually originated in Rome so this is the best place to get it. The dish only requires a few simple ingredients, but is difficult to make well (trust me, I've tried). It's a simple pasta dish made from pasta, egg, cheese and pancetta.",
