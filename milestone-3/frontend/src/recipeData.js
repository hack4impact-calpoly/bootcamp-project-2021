      "description": "Carbonara has by far been my favorite dish here in Rome. It actually originated in Rome so this is the best place to get it. The dish only requires a few simple ingredients, but is difficult to make well (trust me, I've tried). It's a simple pasta dish made from pasta, egg, cheese and pancetta.",

      "description": "The pizza here in Italy doesn't even compare to my usual Domino's order at home. It's much more thin than US pizza and it doesn't feel as heavy. My favorite pizza is made from the simple combination of flour, fresh tomato sauce, and mozarella cheese (optional).",

      "description": "I recently had the BEST risotto of my life in a small town called Anzio. I certainly don't know how to make this dish, much less make it well. But I wanted to share this dish in case anyone out there hadn't heard of it before. It's a delicious combination of rice (risotto) and a variety of seafood.",
