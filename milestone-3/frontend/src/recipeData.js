A French omelet is whisked with a fork while the eggs to cook to create a structure more like scrambled eggs and then rolled into a log. An American omelet using a dragging method to push the cooked eggs to the inside and the uncooked egg to the outside. Both yield a well cooked and fluffy omelet, but the French style has a more custard like texture and sits taller since it's rolled.",
