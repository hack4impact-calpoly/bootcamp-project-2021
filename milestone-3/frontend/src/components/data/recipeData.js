Paired with a tangy, fresh cocktail sauce, this delicious recipe is the perfect start to an evening filled with friends, food, and fun.\n\nWe think 16–20 per pound are the perfect size, and that’s what this recipe was developed for (the size will be printed on the bag the shrimp are packaged in, or ask your fishmonger). If you end up with a different size, just follow these guidelines: For 26–30, poach 1½ minutes; for 21–25, poach 2 minutes; for 13–15, poach 4 minutes; for 8–12, poach 5 minutes.

Cook, stirring occasionally but not breaking meat apart, until beef is lightly browned but not crisp, 6–8 minutes. It may be gray in spots (that’s okay!) and still a little pink in the center. Using a slotted spoon, transfer beef to a medium bowl.",

Reduce heat to medium-low and cook, smashing down on beef with a wooden spoon, until wine is evaporated, surface of pot is almost dry, and meat is finely ground, 12–15 minutes. (The meat should be reduced to what looks like little bits. It takes a bit of effort, but you can take breaks.) Add tomato paste, bay leaf, and nutmeg and cook, stirring occasionally and still pressing down on meat, until tomato paste is slightly darkened, about 5 minutes.",
            "Pour stock and milk into pot; add a pinch of salt. Reduce heat to the lowest setting and cook, uncovered and stirring occasionally, until meat is very, very tender, 2–2½ hours. There shouldn’t be any rapid bubbles at this stage. Instead, the sauce should release the occasional small bubble or two. When finished, the sauce should have the texture of and look like a sloppy joe mixture. If the liquid reduces before the meat is completely tender, add an extra ½ cup stock and continue cooking. Discard bay leaf. Taste sauce and adjust seasoning with salt; keep warm.",

        "recipeDescription": "Truly a classic, this chocolate chip cookie features high quality ingredients that will not only make this the best chocolate chip cookie you've ever had, but be a wonderful bookend desert to any meal in any occasion.\n\nWhat makes this recipe deliver on that promise? Crispy edges, a chewy center, and a recipe that turns out consistently delicious homemade chocolate chip cookies every single time—all without a mixer. The browned butter is key to this recipe, helping it stay rooted in classic cookie flavor while also contributing to that perfect balance of crisp-chewy textures—an ideal combo whether you dunk your cookies in milk or not. The quality of the vanilla is also important here; we recommend Heilala or Neilsen-Massey, which both have enough heft to stand up to bitter chocolate and molasses-y dark brown sugar.\n\nThe recipe below is designed to act as a guide, and not something to be followed prescriptively.

Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute. Cut remaining ¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).",
            "Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add egg and egg yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk in vanilla. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in chocolate (the dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).",
            "Using a 1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets."
