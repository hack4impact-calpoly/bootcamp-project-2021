Tie a bit of baking string around the top section of gathered tortilla to hold it in place, pulling it enough so that the tortilla isn't simply straight up &amp; down but comes in a little bit at the top (see photo). Brush some butter in the folds of the tortilla &amp; lift the whole thing up to brush butter underneath, on the tray. Slide it all into the oven &amp; bake until the edges of the tortilla are golden brown &amp; the tortilla is stiff, about 5-10 mins. Remove from the oven &amp; untie the string. Carefully open the tortilla gathers just a little bit, enough to remove the ramekin (I used small tongs &amp; lifted at an angle). Put a couple of small lettuce leaves in the tortilla &amp; then layer the other filling ingredients how you'd like, plus the optional sour cream.",
            "Triangle Style: Heat a large pan on medium heat. Lay a tortilla on a flat surface &amp; use kitchen scissors to trim the edges so that you have a sort-of triangle (see photo). Layer the fixings on the tortilla in whatever order you'd like (optional sour cream, no lettuce) &amp; then fold 1 corner in to the center, butter it, fold in another corner, slightly overlapping the first as shown, brushing with more butter, &amp; then fold over the 3rd corner to overlap like an envelope. Brush the whole side with butter &amp; lay it in the pan, fold side down. Brush the top with more butter. Cook for a few minutes, until the folds stay closed, &amp; then flip the triangle over. Cook for another couple minutes. Remove to a plate and enjoy! The tortilla cuttings can be brushed with butter &amp; baked or fried 'til lightly golden brown."
