        <p class="search-item-2">Traditionally, grilled cheese calls for bread, butter, and cheese. This version uses garlic and parmesean seasoning, combined with
        a culmination of cheeses to create an intricate blend of the "perfect bite". While it's not the most healthy foods reccomended, it's an absolute must on 
        cheat days!</p>

        <p class="search-item-2">Spaghetti Squash is a great alternative to using regular pasta. 
          While there is only one way to actually cook the squash, the dishes you can make with the cooked "pasta" are endless. 
          A perfect meal on a busy night!</p>
