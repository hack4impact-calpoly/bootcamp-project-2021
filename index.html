          You made it to my website! Did you know waffles are just pancake with abs and a sad coffee is called a depresso? No, you probably didn't nor do you care... 
          I wanted to set the scene with the kind of jokes you'll see throughout. Without further ado, please check out some of 
          "my" tasty recipes - sorry mom! They are cravings I get all the time, and hopefully they fulfill yours!

          Traditionally, grilled cheese calls for bread, butter, and cheese. This version uses garlic and parmesean seasoning, combined with
        a culmination of cheeses to create an intricate blend of the "perfect bite". While it's not the most healthy foods reccomended, it's an absolute must on 
        cheat days!</p>

          Spaghetti Squash is a great alternative to using regular pasta. 
          While there is only one way to actually cook the squash, the dishes you can make with the cooked "pasta" are endless. 
          A perfect meal on a busy night!</p>
